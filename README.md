# visualizing-spatial-audio-in-digital-landscapes
 This research explores methods for visualizing spatial audio as point clouds in order to create immersive experiences of heritage landscapes. The integration of spatial audio can enrich existing landscape recording practices, particularly those which involve three-dimensional scanning. By combining point clouds and ambisonic recordings, expressions of human and ecological activity can be placed in a virtual landscape, recording both the physical and sensory environment. This synthesized experience can be visualized through exploratory audiovisual modulation. Spectrogram and landscape point clouds can be combined to highlight how space and sound interact. Likewise, dynamic point cloud animation can provide a synesthetic representation of sound in the landscape.
